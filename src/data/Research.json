    "image": "images/APF1.png",
    "description": "In this work we designed and demonstrated wide-band true-time-delay lines using integrated circuit Gm-C filters. The proposed architecture achieved state-of-the-art delay-bandwidth product among all the true-time-delay lines hitherto reported at the time of publication."

    "image": "images/Expansion.png",
    "description": "This work was a first demonstration of an integrated circuit implementation of expansion and compression of continuous-time, wideband analog pulses. Pulse expansion and compression factors of 1.8x and 1.7x respectively were demonstrated using electronically controlled bandwidth switching of Gm-C filters."

    "image": "images/OTA1.png",
    "description": "This work proposed a transconductor architecture useful for wideband Gm-C filters which can achieve large unity gain frequency without compromising DC gain. An automatically controlled, incremental negative conductance load was designed to cancel the incremental positive conductance of the transconductor across process, voltage and temperature variation."
